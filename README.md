## **LaravMad: Laravel Machine Decision tree**

Managing calorie intake is a fundamental aspect of personal health and fitness. However, calculating calorie consumption accurately requires understanding multiple factors such as weight, activity levels, and lifestyle habits. Many individuals find this process challenging and time-consuming, limiting their ability to make informed health decisions.  

Our solution is a **Calorie Prediction Platform** that leverages **machine learning (decision tree algorithm)** to deliver fast, accurate, and personalized calorie predictions. Designed for integration into modern health and fitness ecosystems, this platform is powered by cutting-edge technologies to ensure scalability, reliability, and ease of use.
